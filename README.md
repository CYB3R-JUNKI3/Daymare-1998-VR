_Rule of thumb_

If what you are reading is attached to your Right Controller (documents/tuts/D.I.D etc..) then use the Right Stick to change page

Everything else (Such as "Y/N" PC's/Switches/puzzles etc..) then use the Left Stick.
- No change to game controls

## Important Notes
- Hand gun aiming is pretty accurate
- Shotgun a bit off at close range 
- Both Raven and Samuel "DownTown" levels, extremely poor performance and jitter badly in some places (game issue)
- When Samuel is "Hallucinating" you will temporarily lose aiming ability, This Is Intentional, Not A Bug.
- You may see your character silhouette when your D.I.D is open (this stops you falling through the map)
- There is pretty bad "Pop-In" on Samuel's Lighthouse level, left as-is, felt fitting as he is hallucinating.
